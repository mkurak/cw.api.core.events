# Changelog

## [1.1.3] - 2025-09-21
### Added
- Added a smoke test covering async event triggering, result piping, and unsubscribe behaviour.
### Changed
- Documentation now guides releases through `npm version <type>` followed by `git push --follow-tags`.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-09-21
### Changed
- Removed the `release` npm script and refreshed README/DEV_NOTES to favour `npm version <type>` + `git push --follow-tags`.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-09-20
- Normalised project documentation to English across README, DEV_NOTES, and the
  changelog to honour language guidelines.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-20
- Added the `eventsModule` and `useEvents()` helpers so `EventBus` registers as a
  singleton inside the DI container.
- Introduced a module-focused Jest scenario that verifies the singleton
  behaviour.
- Updated README/DEV_NOTES with DI integration guidance.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-20
- Marked the event bus stable: sync/async chaining, lifecycle hooks, metadata checks,
  and automated tag pushes are now backed by semver guarantees.
- No API changes were required; packages already using 0.x can upgrade without code changes.

## [0.2.3] - 2025-09-20
- Documented automatic `git push --follow-tags` behaviour and ensured repository metadata stays in sync across commits.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-09-20
- Added package metadata validation hooks and post-commit auto-tagging when versions change on the default branch.
- Populated `repository`, `bugs`, and `homepage` fields to satisfy npm provenance requirements.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-20
- Introduced the fully typed `EventBus` with synchronous/asynchronous event modes, result piping, stop semantics, and trigger metadata.
- Added lifecycle core events (`CORE_EVENTS`) covering before/after trigger, subscriber errors, and subscription mutations for diagnostics.
- Expanded documentation and authored a comprehensive Jest suite for sync/async chains, error handling, metadata flow, and event removal.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-20
- Minor template maintenance after the initial scaffold.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-20
- Initial release scaffolded by cw.helper.package.generator.
